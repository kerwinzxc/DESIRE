[DESIRE](https://github.com/nyaki-HUN/DESIRE)
=============================================

Development Experiment for a Simple Innovative and Roboust Engine

What is it?
-----------
This is an experimental porject to create an Engine which makes game development easier.
The main focus is on creating a simple to use and powerful framework.

This is not a simple, plug-and-play engine.  
If you think about cars, other game engines are more like having the whole car, changing parts, painting and customizing it for you.
DESIRE is more like a high-performance engine where you still need to build the car around.  

Features
--------

 * TODO
 * Modular design - each module can be easily replaced with other or custom implementations
 * All project files are generated and maintained via premake5

The currently supported platforms are:

 * Windows 10
